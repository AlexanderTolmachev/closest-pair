Ð¡losest pair task solver
========================

This project contains two implementations of closest pair task solver:
  * Simple, with O(N^2) time complexity.
  * Fast, with O(N*logN) time complexity.
  
Usage: `java -jar closest-pair.jar <mode> <input-file>` <br/>
`<mode>` - "simple" or "fast" <br/>
`<input-file>` - input file in txt format, see samples in "dist" directory
