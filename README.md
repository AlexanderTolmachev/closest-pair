Ð¡losest pair task solver
========================

This project contains two implementations of closest pair task solver:
  * Simple, with O(N^2) time complexity.
  * Fast, with O(N*logN) time complexity.
  
Usage: closest-pair.jar <mode> <input-file>
<mode> - "simple" or "fast"
<input-file> - input file in txt format, see samples in "dist" directory
